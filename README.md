Employee SQL
Data Modelling
Based on the CSV files provided, an ERD of possible tables was designed. All the three data models were considered while designing – conceptual model, logical model and physical model :

Data Engineering
Along with the ERD, table schema was created keeping in mind the specifications of data types, primary keys, foreign keys and other constraints. Tables were created in the correct order to handle the foreign keys. CSVs were imported into the corresponding SQL table.

Data Analysis
Once the database was completed, the following were done:
* Listed the details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
* Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
* Listed the manager of each department with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, first name.
* Listed the department number for each employee with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* Listed first name, last name, and sex for each employee whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with letter "B."
* Listed each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name.
* Listed each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* Listed the frequency count of employee last names in descending order, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
